# Excel to XML Converter using Python lxml

## Overview
This repository provides a Python script to convert Excel files (.xlsx) to XML format using the lxml library. The script reads data from an Excel spreadsheet and dynamically generates an XML file by creating XML tags and embedding data from the Excel cells. This tool is particularly useful for data integration tasks, where data stored in Excel needs to be converted into XML format for interoperability with different systems.

## Features
  - Excel to XML Conversion: Converts the entire Excel sheet or specific rows and columns to XML format.
  + Dynamic XML Tag Generation: Automatically generates XML tags based on column headers or specified naming conventions.
  * Flexible Configuration: Allows customization of XML output, such as root element name and data element names.

## Requirements
  _ Python 3.x
  + pandas for reading Excel files
  * lxml for generating XML files

## Installation
Install the required libraries using pip:
  **pip install pandas lxml**
